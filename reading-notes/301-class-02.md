## Lists and Keys

- What does .map() return?
  .map() will loop through an array, complete some form of data manipulation, and return a brand new array the same length of the original. 
- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
  The individual indexes ( .map(idx) ) that are needing to be displayed will be placed in a list.
  ```const myArray = [0,10,20];
  let listItems = myArray.map((number =>
     <li>number</li>
     );```
Then the listItems array is passed into a ul and rendered through reactDOM.render

- Each list item needs a unique ___key___.
- What is the purpose of a key?
  A key will inform React if a list item has been altered, added, or removed. 
  
  ## Spread Operators 
  
- What is the spread operator?
  Using an ```(...)``` the spread operator expands iterables into a list of arguments.
- List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
  1. Expand interable into arugments 2. Copying Arrays 3. Concatenating Arrays together 4. Adding to State in React
- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
  ```firstArray = [1,2,3];
  secondArray = [4,5,6];
  finalArray = [...firstArray, ...secondArray];
  console.log(finalArray); // [1,2,3,4,5,6]```
- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
  ```firstArray = [1,2];
  newArray = [...firstArray, 3,4,5,6];
  console.log(newArray); //[1,2,3,4,5,6]```
- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one
  ```object1 = {daytime: 'hello'}
  object2 = {nighttime: 'goodnight'}
  object3 = {...object1, ...object2, morning: 'good morning'}
  console.log(object3); // {daytime: 'hello', nighttime: 'goodnight', morning: 'good morning'}```
