## Pain and Suffering

> Suffering is pain without purpose.

What will become possibly one of the most important and relevant reads of my Code Fellows career, this article pulls into focus the reason 
I am pursuing this path and the cost that comes with it. I've felt it already in 201 and 301, but I need to be reminded that this will be 
a difficult journey, but for a good cause. Growth is often painful, and this course is no exception. 

## Introduction to Big O Notation

### What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation is used to denote the complexity of an algorithm, either based on the time it takes to execute or the amount of space it takes up. 

- O(1) - will always execute in the same time or space regardless of input
- O(N) - the i(N)put (see what I did there?) determines the time/complexity of the algorithm linearly so the bigger N is, the longer the execution of code
will be, proportionately.
- O(N^2) - the square of the input size is proportional to performance. Nested for loops are great examples. 
```
for x in range(0,n):
  for y in range(0, n):
    print(x*y)
```
- O(2^N) - this is exponential growth in execution with each increment of N. 
- O(logN) - growth spikes in the first iteration of N, but essentially plateaus.
