## Reading and Writing Python Files

What exactly ___is___ a file?
> ...a file is a continguous set of bytes used to store data. 
 
 ### Parts of a Modern File
 
 1. Header - the overall information about the file (name, size, type, etc)
 2. Data - the meat and potatoes of the file
 3. End of File (EOF) - a characted marking the end of the file.

### Opening and Closing Files in Python

- Open - open('filename.ext')
  - Once open ___always___ make sure to close the file when done. 
  - Try and Finally help here:
- Closing
```
reader = open('my_file.txt)
try:
  # Do some things
finally:
   reader.close()
```
### Ok Now What?

-.read()  - reads entire file
-.realine() - reads entire line
-.readlines() - reads remaining lines from file
-.write(string) - does what it says
-.writelines(seq) - writes with no line endings, that is up to you

## Exceptions

- ___raise___ can be used to throw an exception if a particular condition occurs.
```
x = 3
if x > 30:
  raise Exception('X shoul d exceed 30')
```
- try/except blocks are used to like try/catch in JS
  - 'error' may also be used as keyword and printed (except AssertionError as error: print(error) )
  - A try block will be exectued until the point an exception occurs, then skips any remaining code into the except block
  - an 'else' block may be used at the end, and is run if there are no exceptions
  - 'finally' blacks will run no matter the exception status
