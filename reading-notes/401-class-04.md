# Reading 

## Classes and  Objects

- Objects are a group of variables and functions that belong together
- Classes allow you to create your objects

```
class Dog:
    color = "Yellow"

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof woof!")

pluto = Dog()
```

You can use dot notation to access variables in the newly created object. 

```
print(pluto.color)

"Yellow"
```

Assigning variables can be accomplished with __init__
```
class NumberHolder:

   def __init__(self, number):
       self.number = number

   def returnNumber(self):
       return self.number

var = NumberHolder(7)
print(var.returnNumber()) #Prints '7'
```

## Thinking Recursively

1. Reduce problem into simpler instances
2. The base case is the most reduced version of the problem
3. Thread the 'state' through each iteration by passing it to each recursive call

## Fixtures

- During testing using pytest, some objects may want to be used throughout all tests. These are fixtures.
- The @pytest.fixture decorator is used on objects you would like to access further in tests
