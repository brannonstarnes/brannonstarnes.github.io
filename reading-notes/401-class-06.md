## What is Risk Analysis in Software Development

- This describes the process of identifying risk, assessing the severity, and making decisions to mitigate those risks. 
- Certain risks cannot be avoided, such as the time used in tests, customer urgency, and incomplete requirements.
- Risk Magnitude can be assigned to each risk factor: High, Medium, Low
- Cause, Effect, and Likelihood, when applied to each risk factor, will help prioritize the order and need for mitigating solutions.

## What is Test Coverage?

- Test coverage is looking for untested parts of code and ....getting it tested!

### How Do You Know if You Have Done Enough Testing?

> - You rarely get bugs that escape into production, and
> - You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.

- It is certainly possible to test ___too___ much.
  - are your tests slowing you down?
  - can you remove tests without affecting coverage?
