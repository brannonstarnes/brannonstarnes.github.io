## List Comprehensions
Why?
 - Simple and elegant ways to manage lists
 - Very compact 
 - Faster (usually) than for loops
 - More flexible than for loops

### Anatomy of a List Comprehension
```
  my_new_list = [ expression for item in list ]
```
1) First, the expression we want carried out, ___in___ the square brackets. Here, it is ___expression___
2) The object we want the expression working on. In this case ___item___.
3) Last, the iterable list. Here, it is ___list___.

### Example 1

```
# construct a basic list using range() and list comprehensions
# syntax
# [ expression for item in list ]

digits = [x for x in range(10)]
print(digits)

prints: [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
```

### Example 2
```
# create a list using list comprehension

squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print(squares)

prints: [ 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 ]
```

### Example 3
Strings in a list may also be manipulated by the expression:

```
my_list = ["Hello World"]
yell = [letter.upper() for letter in my_list]
print(yell)

prints: ["HELLO WORLD!"]
```

## More Complexity, More Power

### Example 4

Here we can assign different object variables ( x and y ) to different lists, and use them in an expression.
```
nums = [x+y for x in [1,2,3] for y in [10,20,30]]
print(nums)

prints: [11, 21, 31, 12, 22, 32, 13, 23, 33]
```
