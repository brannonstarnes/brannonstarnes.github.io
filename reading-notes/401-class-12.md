## Pandas üêº

Pandas is a Python library that is full of tools which can be used for data analysis. Pandas uses DataFrames to organize and manipulate data. 

First, import pandas:
```import pandas as pd```

Methods called on the DataFrame (df) can remove, group, and plot and graph the df data. Pandas strength lies in the ability to quickly reorganize a df into
an easily readable table with the desired categories being taken into consideration and displayed. 

## Creating a DataFrame

Below, a dictionary of objects is converted to a series. 
```
df2 = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "A": 1.0,
        "B": pd.Timestamp("20130102"),
        "C": pd.Series(1, index=list(range(4)), dtype="float32"),
        "D": np.array([3] * 4, dtype="int32"),
        "E": pd.Categorical(["test", "train", "test", "train"]),
        "F": "foo",
    }
)


df2
Out[10]: 
     A          B    C  D      E    F
0  1.0 2013-01-02  1.0  3   test  foo
1  1.0 2013-01-02  1.0  3  train  foo
2  1.0 2013-01-02  1.0  3   test  foo
3  1.0 2013-01-02  1.0  3  train  foo
```

Pandas allows the user to write to Excel or CSV files, and can push data to Numpy for plotting. 


### A Growing List of Useful Methods:

- __DataFrame.to_numpy()__ gives a NumPy representation of your data. This is fast when all data types are the same, but expensive when they vary.
- __describe()__ provides a quick summary of your data
- __T__ transposes data
- __stack()__ ‚Äúcompresses‚Äù a level in the DataFrame‚Äôs columns.
- __to_csv("spam.csv")__ writes to a DF file.
