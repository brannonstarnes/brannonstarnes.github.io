## Linear Regression

A linear regression takes an explanatory variable and a response variable and plots their relationship via scatterplot. A line is then drawn through the plots that 
represents the expected relationship between the two variables, based on that data.

- Scikit-learn is a Python module that contains tools for machine learning and includes a regression tool.

```
import sklearn
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

### A Few Important Linear Regression Methods:
>lm.fit() -> fits a linear model
>
>lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
>
>lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, 
>as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
