# Anatomy of a Binary Tree

A binary tree is a collection of nodes organized in branching child nodes. The max number of children a node can have is determined by the value of K. In binary
trees, this value is k=2. The final nodes containing no children are known as leaf nodes.

As you can see in the above image, the root node has two children, a left and right child. Those children each may have a left and right child as well. The connection
between each node is called an edge. 

# Traversal of a Tree

Two methods may be used when traversing a tree:

- Depth First
- Breadth First

### Let's Examine the Depth First Method (Stack Method)

Within the depth method, three different orders may be taken when stepping through the nodes, as seen here:

- Pre-order: root >> left >> right (Order: A, B, C, D, E, F)
- In-order: left >> root >> right (Order: D, B, E, A, F, C)
- Post-order: left >> right >> root (D, E, B, F, C, A)
