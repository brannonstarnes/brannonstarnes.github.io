## Serverless 

This is a cloud execution model that allows the customer to focus on their front end development and let the cloud manage the back end. In other words, 
the customer never really sees or interacts with the back end. 

### FaaS 

__Function as a Service__ is a subset of serverless. Baiscally a compute function of serverless. 

### Benefits of Serverless

1. Pay only for execution time
2. Auto Scalable
3. Faster To Market
4. Many languages
5. Highly Available

__Kubernetes__ is an open-source container platform and makes the development of conatinaer-based applications much simpler. Kubernetes cannot run serverless apps
on its own, however, and requires software integration. __Knative__ is an extension to Kubernetes that will allow any container to run on any cloud that uses 
Kubernetes. 

## How is Serverless Being Used?

- Microservices - single job API communications
- API Backends
- Data Processing
- Massively parallel compute/Map ops
