# Crytptography

- Cryptography is the science of systematically scrambling information to keep its contents hidden from anyone not suthorized to view it. 
  - Plain-text - the intended message or unscrambled data
  - ciphertext - the encrypted data 
  - cipher - the exact method or algorithm used to manipulate the plain-text
- Polymorphism - a cipher that changes itself with each use ( like the German Enigma Machine ).

## Example, The Ceasar Cipher

When Juilus Ceasar ruled over the Roman Empire, he used a simple cipher to encrpyt his messages. The Ceasar Cipher, as it is known, shifted all letters of the 
alphabet up or down a predetermined number of spaces. Ceasar typcially used a shift of 3, therefore, A -> D, E -> H, L -> O and so on. This simple ciphering method 
is widely known and easy to crack, therefore, cannot be used in any serious application. 

## Modern Cryptography

Today, we use more sophisticated methods to encrypt our important data. Diffie-Hellman key exchange uses Modular Exponentiation. What this means is the sender and 
receiver each apply a secret number as an exponent in a formula. When each secret exponent is applied to the same formula the result is the same. 
In the example below, the sender uses X as their secret exponent, and the receiver uses Y:

> B^x mod M <-----------> B^y mod M
> results in
> (B^xy mod M)

A shared key is established!

## Symmetric Encryption vs Asymmetric
- Symmetric - Both parties receive a private key
- Asymmetric - one party receives a private key and the other only receives the public key (RSA encrpytion)
