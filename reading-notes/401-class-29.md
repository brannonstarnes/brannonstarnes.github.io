## Custom Users in Django

Upon installation, Django comes with a built in user model that is ready to go right out of the box. However, for real world applications, creating a custom
user model will give you the flexibility to create and manage your user's accounts.  

To start, create a new Django project from the command line. We need to do several things:

### Getting Started

1. create and navigate into a dedicated directory called accounts for our code
2. install Django
3. make a new Django project called config
4. make a new app accounts
5. start the local web server

Here are the commands:

```
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir accounts && cd accounts
$ pipenv install django~=3.1.0
$ pipenv shell
(accounts) $ django-admin.py startproject config .
(accounts) $ python manage.py startapp accounts
(accounts) $ python manage.py runserver
```

Note: do not run migrate until after the custom user model is created. 

### Creating the Model

1. update config/settings.py (add accounts to installed apps)
2. create a CustomUser model (in accounts/models.py)
3. create UserCreation and UserChangeForm  (accounts/forms.py)
4. update admin ()
5. makemigrations and migrate
6. make templates, urls, views
