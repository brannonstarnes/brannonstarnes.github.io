## Docker

Docker provides the ability to package up an entire application and its environment, and distribute it to anyone on any platform.  

These containers are Linux containers.  

Install Docker and test with :
```
docker run hello-world
```
- Image is a snapshot in time of what a project contains.
- Container is a running instance of the image.
