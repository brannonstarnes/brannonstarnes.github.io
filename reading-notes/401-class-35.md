# Reading 35

## Graphs

Graphs are non-linear data structures containing nodes, connected by edges.

1. Vertex - 'node', the data object
2. Edge - connection between vertices
3. Neighbor - adjacent node
4. Degree - number of edges connected to a vertex

### Directed vs Undirected

#### Undirected

A graph where each edge is uni-directional or bi-directional. This means the edges do not POINT toward a particular direction.

#### Directed

Also called a ```Digraph```, a directed graph contains edges which all point to a particular direction or node.

### Complete, Connected, Disconnected

```Complete``` - all nodes are connected with each other.

```Connected``` - all nodes have at least one edge.

```Disconnected``` - Some nodes may not be connected.

### Cyclic vs Acyclic

```Cyclic``` graphs can be traversed and arrive back where they started. ```Acyclic``` graphs have no cycles.


### Adjacency Matrix

A two dimensional array that represents the connections between nodes. 0 means no connections. 1 represents a present connection.

### Traversal

#### Breadth First

1. Enqueue the start node
2. Create while loop (while node: )
3. Dequeue first node
4. If dequeued node has unvisited children, add children to visited and insert into queue

```
ALGORITHM BreadthFirst(vertex)
    DECLARE nodes <-- new List()
    DECLARE breadth <-- new Queue()
    DECLARE visited <-- new Set()

    breadth.Enqueue(vertex)
    visited.Add(vertex)

    while (breadth is not empty)
        DECLARE front <-- breadth.Dequeue()
        nodes.Add(front)

        for each child in front.Children
            if(child is not visited)
                visited.Add(child)
                breadth.Enqueue(child)   

    return nodes;
```
#### Depth First

1. Push root into stack
2. While stack not empty:
3. Peek stack
4. If top node has unvisited children, mark top as visited and push unvisited children back into stack
5. If top has 0 unvisited children, Pop stack
6. Repeat until empty
