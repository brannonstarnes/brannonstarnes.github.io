### Rendering an Element into the DOM

```
<div id="root"></div>
```

This is a 'root' DOM node. Anything passed into it will be managed by Readct DOM. In order to render a React element in the root node, pass the element and the node into 
```ReactDOM.render()```

For example:
```
const myElement = <h1>Hi there!</h1>
ReactDOM.render(myElement, document.getElementById('root')
```

### Updating Rendered Elements

- React elements are immutable
- The only way to update the UI is to create a new element with ReactDOM.render()
