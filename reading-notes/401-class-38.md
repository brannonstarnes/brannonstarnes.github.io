## Thinking in React

1. Break The UI Into a Component Hierarchy
  - Essentially, wireframing with component name labels
  - Hierarchy works like a nested list.
2. Build a Static Version in React
  - No interactivity at this point, no state
3. Identify the Minimal Representation of UI State
4. Identify Where your State Should Live 
5. Add Inverse Data Flow
