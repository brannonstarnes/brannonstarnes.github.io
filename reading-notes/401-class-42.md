## What are Python Generators?

Python generators are functions that have the ability to create, or generate, a type of value. The key word in a generator function is ```yield```. 

```
def threes(start,stop):
  for num in range(start, stop + 1, 3):
    yield num
```

When this block of code is envoked, a generator is created, but not run.  In order to produce a value from the generator, we need to call ```next``` on the generator.

```
> gen = threes(3,21)
> next(gen)
> 3
> next(gen)
> 6
> next(gen)
> 9 
> ...
> 21
> next(gen)
> StopIteration
```

Notice each next call generates only one value, the ```next``` value in line from the generator. After the last value is reached, if next is called again, a 
```StopIteratoin``` message will appear.

If ```list``` is called on the generator, a list will be created containing all the values of the generator.

```
> list(gen)
> [3,6,9,12,15,18,21]
>
```

This could also be accomplished in a list comprehension.

```
def gen_list():
  third_values = [num for num in threes(3,21)]
  print(third_values)
  
 > gen_list()
 > [3,6,9,12,15,18,21]
 ```
